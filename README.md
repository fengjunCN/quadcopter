Python code for Quadcopter

I will use a rasbperry Pi V 2 or B+ in order to read sensors and write ESC controller to controll Brushless Motors.
The Copter will be 4+4 Motored with handmade chassey.

This project is a privat project and you can use the code for your own purpose. I am not reliable for damage made with this code. So if you destroy your own equipment, it's your business
